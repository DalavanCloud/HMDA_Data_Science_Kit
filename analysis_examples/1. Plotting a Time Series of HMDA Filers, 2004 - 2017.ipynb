    "# Plotting a Time Series of HMDA Filers, 2004 - 2017  \n",
    "\n",
    "Information from [transmittal sheets](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#hmda-datasets) loaded into a local postgres database will be required to produce a time series of HMDA filers between 2004 and 2017. One would first need to fulfill the system requirements for running the processes in this notebook, instructions for which may be found [here](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#requirements). Transmittal sheet data, along with LAR and Panel data may be loaded in to a local postgres database from the command line. One would first [need to download and unzip files of each data set](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#downloading-and-unzipping-data), and then [load in tables](https://github.com/cfpb/HMDA_Data_Science_Kit#creating-postgres-tables-and-loading-data) of each file into a postgres database. A postgres database provides functionality for SQL; it allows one to pull data from multiple tables with the same SQL command, and create new dataframes with only the data necessary to complete a research task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once LAR, TS, and Panel data are loaded into a local database, one would be able to connect to that database from a Jupyter notebook using a Python library called Pyscopg2. Pyscopg2 provides functionality for pulling data from postgres databases with SQL and for transforming the results into Python-compatible outputs. The SQL commands with Psycopg2 may be called from a string variable or from a SQL script file in a directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this notebook demonstrates how SQL commands with Psycopg2 may be used to pull counts and year from each transmittal sheet into a local database, and translate those results to a Python dictionary. Python dictionaries that utilize key-value pair data structures create a framework for a Pandas dataframe. One may set the keys in a Python dictionary to be column names and the subsequent values to be rows of output. The Pd.Dataframe() function with the Pandas library would then be applied to a dictionary so that results may be placed into a Pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas dataframes allow one to view output with different styles, select columns, clean data, save results to new files with different extentions, and produce visualizations. For example, this notebook aims to create a dataframe of the number of filers and the year from each transmittal sheet, organized into rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib will be used in this notebook to take entries in a dataframe and create a bar chart displaying results. Matplotlib creates charts, and visualizations using arrays of data that may be pulled from dataframes and other data sctructures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this notebook contains methodology for studying data in this repository, but also provides functions one may use to take a SQL command and quickly transform output into a dataframe or a bar chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may first begin this analysis by importing the following libraries:"
